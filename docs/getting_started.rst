Getting Started
===============

What is needed to work on OreSat Linux projects?
------------------------------------------------

- Access to Linux (like an VM).
- A GitHub account.

What do first
-------------

- Skim thru https://www.oresat.org/
- Skim thru the rest of this documentation.
- Jump on zoom for the OreSat General meeting on Friday at 2pm PST. See
  the Google Calendar on https://www.oresat.org/ for Zoom link.
- Get on OreSat's Slack.
- Ask to join the OreSat's GitHub Organization, there is no need to fork
  OreSat's repos unless you want to.

Task board
----------

- We try use GitHub Issue and GitHub Projects for all tasks that needed to be
  done (bug fixes, new features, etc). See https://github.com/orgs/oresat/projects/6/views/1
- Not all things that need to be worked on are added to GitHub Issues.
- Anyone is free to work on any GitHub Issue that is not assigned to anyone
  else, but you must assign yourself to the GitHub Issue if you are working on
  it.

Recommendations when joining OreSat
-----------------------------------

- Your probably will feel overwhelmed with how complicated OreSat is. The
  best thing to do is focus on one subsystem, get familiar with subsystem,
  and expand you're knowledge of OreSat a whole at your own rate, as you
  want to.
- Ask lots of questions.
- If something specifically interest you, bother the people working on and
  see how you can help.
