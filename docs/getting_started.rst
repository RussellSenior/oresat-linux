Task board

  done (bug fixes, new features, etc).
- Not all things that need to be worked on are addes to GitHub Issues.
- Anyone is free to work on any GitHub Issue that is not assigned to anyone
  else, but you must assign yourself to the GitHub Issue if you are working on
  it.

Recommendations when joining OreSat
-----------------------------------

- Your problably will feel overwhelmed with how complicated OreSat is. The
  best thing todo is focus on one subsystem, get familier with subsystem,
  and expand you're knowledge of OreSat a whole at your own rate, as you
  want to.
- Ask lots of questions.
- If something specificly insterest you, bother the people working on and
  see how you can help.
