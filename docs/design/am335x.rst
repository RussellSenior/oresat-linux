AM335x
======
Some of our OreSat systems need more computing power, so theyâ€™re given a 
`AM335x`_ that can run Linux. It is commonly found in Beagleboard's 
`PocketBeagle`_.

Key features of the AM335X:

    - A single core 1GHz ARM Cortex A8 processor
    - 2x 200Mhz PRU (Programable Realtime Processors)
    - Version with 1GB of RAM
    - 3D Graphics Accelerator
    - Support for UART, CAN, I2C, & SPI 

See https://www.ti.com/processors/sitara-arm/am335x-cortex-a8/overview.html for 
a full list of features of the AM335x.

Programmable Real-time Unit (PRU)
---------------------------------

A PRU is a microcontroller that shares pins and other resource with the core
processor allowing for custom interface to other hardware like cameras. The 
AM335x has two PRUs. For OreSat an idea is use them to get images from camera
sensors.

Good guides can be found at:

    - `PRU-ICSS`_
    - `TI PRU-ICSS / PRU_ICSSG`_
    - `TI PRU Training`_

TI PRU Code Generation Tools

- On Debian, apt can be used to get it 

.. code-block:: bash

 apt install ti-pru-cgt-installer

- Or get it directy from TI at https://www.ti.com/tool/download/PRU-CGT-2-1.
  The ARM-A8 Installer for PRU CGT one.
