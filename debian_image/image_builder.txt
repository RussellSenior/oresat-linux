Steps:

Note:

** Enable internet in the beaglebone.
** Make sure to use 30 or 60 GB SD card and check if the entire space is enabled.


1. Clone the repository into the beaglebone
	https://github.com/beagleboard/image-builder

2. Move into the image-builder folder.

3. Go to /configs folder and copy a already available .conf file.

	cp configs/bb.org-debian-wheezy-console.conf configs/custom-image.conf

4. In the .conf file if we want to add packages add them under the 
	deb_include.
	
	gcc	\
	libgirepository1.0-dev	\
	libcairo2-dev	\
	libgtk2.0-dev	\
	cmake	\
	libavcodec-dev	\
	libswscale-dev	\
	libavformat-dev	\
	libtbb2	\
	libtbb-dev	\
	libjpeg-dev	\
	libpng-dev	\
	libtiff-dev	\
	libdc1394-22-dev	\
	swig	\
	python3	\
	python3-dev	\
	python3-numpy	\
	python3-scipy	\
	python3-astropy	\
	python3-ply	\
	u-boot-tools	\
	vim	\
	git	\
	i2c-tools	\
	build-essential	\
	apt	\
	apt-utils	\
	
	
5. In the file change the chroot_script variable to the custom-image.sh

	chroot_script="custom-image.sh"
	
	
5. Go to /target/chroot and copy a script and assign it a custom image file.
	
	cp target/chroot/beagleboard.org-console.sh target/chroot/custom-image.sh

6.  Now try to build the image by using the command in the image-builder folder
	./RootStock-NG.sh -c custom-image

7. After this is done, a new folder named deploy will be created. Go inside and 
	run the command 
	
	sudo ./setup_sdcard.sh --img-2gb some-file-name --dtb beaglebone 
	
8. Now compress the image using the command
	
	xz -z -8 -v BBB-eMMC-flasher-debian-7.8-console-armhf-2gb.img
